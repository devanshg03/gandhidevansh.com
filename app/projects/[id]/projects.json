    "description1": "Nola was a startup of mine that started over the summer of 2022. I joined the InnoX Summer Camp held by Hong Kong X Foundation. Throughout the bootcamp, we applied the design thinking framework, along with a LEAN Startup mindset to solve problems we were passionate about. With a theme of 'Green Living' we decided to focus on getting quality, nutritions food on the go, while forgoing plastic waste. We settled on the idea of building a granola bar machine.",
    "description2": "After winning the camp, my team and I decided to put the prize money from the camp towards product development, and pursue this as a real startup. Throughout the course of the next six months, we build countless prototypes of the machine, and I had to learn all aspects of running a startup, from fund raising to talking to potential customers to 3D design and prototyping. My co-founders contributed with their knowledge of Food Science and Product Design.",

    "description1": "CAESD was the first-startup I pursued in the summer after finishing high school. Having a lot of free time and not much to do meant I ended up brainstorming how I could take my graphic design skills as well as a bit of sourcing knowledge to launch a business that I was passionate about. Being fed-up with overpriced phone cases and boring designs, I decided to take things into my own hands with CAESD. Initially, I started with of the shelf designs, but after poor sales, I pivoted to designing cases on demand.",
    "description2": "I spent a lot of time trying to research and convince factories to work with me since I required low MOQs. Through marketing on Instagram and word-of-mouth through my friends, CAESD became a gift-item that provided you an opportunity to gift something meaningful and long-lasting. This initial push and referrals helped me achieve a four-digit revenue in the first 6-months, during my first semester at The University of Hong Kong. However, sales did not last and a more comprehensive look at the market led me to realize that customers in Hong Kong do not buy phone cases often, and that I did not have a significant technological or competitive edge over market giant CASETIFY. However, this experience provided me with valuable insights into the dynamics of the e-commerce industry, customer behavior, and the intricacies of operating a startup.",
