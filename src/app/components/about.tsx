      <p className="mt-6 text-xl text-[#222]">
        Starting my journey in the dynamic city of Shenzhen, I embraced Hong
        Kong's vibrant energy at 11, developing a passion for business and
        creativity. I'm now diving deep into the world of Finance and
        Entrepreneurship, Design and Innovation (EDI) at the University of Hong
        Kong.

        Navigating the global stage with ease, my linguistic toolkit, including
        English, Hindi, Cantonese, and Mandarin, allows me to effortlessly
        connect with diverse cultures.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-xl text-[#222]">
        As a tech enthusiast, I'm thrilled by the transformative potential of
        technology. This passion ignites my entrepreneurial drive and propels me
        to dive deeper into what makes businesses successful.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 text-xl text-[#222]">
        When away from work and uni, I brainstorm fresh startup ideas and chase
        adrenaline on mountain biking trails. The thrill of creation and the
        rush of the wind are what truly exhilarate me.
